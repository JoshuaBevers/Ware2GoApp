New Wave, Punk and other experimental genres were finding a ready audience and were changing the shape of music forever. Relegated to the southernmost tip of the state, Miami's influential rock artists were one of the nation's best-kept secrets. On January, 28, 2007, The Kids, Z-Cars, Critical Mass, Charlie Pickett, The Cichlids, Slyder, Tight Squeeze and special guests The Romantics took the stage at Club Cinema in Pompano Beach, Florida to the delight of nearly 3,000 fans that came from around the world to see their favorite bands play together one more time. The event culminated in South Florida's biggest reunion concert. This extraordinary untold story has been brought to the forefront and examines the compelling and often personal journey of eight original Miami bands and their quest to leave an indelible mark on the music they loved.",

Johnny Depp guides the visually stunning journey, smashing narrative conventions, moving seamlessly from interview to animation and in the finest Gonzo tradition questions of witness and authenticity are challenged. Steadman's art is for the first time animated, including illustrations from Hunter S Thompson's Fear and Loathing in Las Vagas. Featuring Richard E Grant, Terry Gilliam, Bruce Robinson and with music from Slash, The All American Rejects, Jason Mraz, Crystal Castles, Ed Hardcourt and Beth Orton. A touching and at times funny film about honesty, friendship and the ambition driving an artist. This is a true record of the demise of the 20th Century counterculture and hipster dream with Ralph Steadman the last of the Gonzo visionaries.",
